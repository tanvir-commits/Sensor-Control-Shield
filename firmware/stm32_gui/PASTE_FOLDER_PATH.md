# How to Paste Folder Path in File Dialog

## Method 1: Use the Path Bar (Easiest)

1. **Click on the path bar** at the top of the dialog
   - It shows: `<a SquareLine_Studio >`
   - Click directly on this path bar
   
2. **Press `Ctrl+L`** (or `Ctrl+Shift+L` in some dialogs)
   - This shows a text field where you can type/paste
   
3. **Paste your path:**
   ```
   /home/a/projects/DeviceOps/firmware/stm32_gui/assets
   ```
   
4. **Press Enter**
   - Dialog will navigate to that folder

## Method 2: Type in Path Bar

1. **Click the path bar** (where it shows "SquareLine_Studio")
2. **Type or paste** the full path:
   ```
   /home/a/projects/DeviceOps/firmware/stm32_gui/assets
   ```
3. **Press Enter**

## Method 3: Navigate Manually

1. Click **"+ Other Locations"** at bottom of left sidebar
2. Click **"Computer"** or **"/"** (root)
3. Navigate: `home` → `a` → `projects` → `DeviceOps` → `firmware` → `stm32_gui` → `assets`

## Quick Paths for Your Project
