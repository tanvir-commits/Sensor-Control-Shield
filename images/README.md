# Schematic Images

This directory should contain the schematic diagrams referenced in `HARDWARE_SPECIFICATION.md`:

1. **ads1015_schematic.png** - ADS1015 typical application circuit
   - Shows power connections, analog inputs (AIN0-AIN3), I2C interface, address configuration, and decoupling capacitor

2. **sy6280aac_schematic.png** - SY6280AAC typical application circuit (200mA current limit)
   - Shows input/output connections, enable control, current limit resistor (RSET = 34kΩ), and decoupling capacitors (CIN, COUT = 10µF)

**Note:** These images can be extracted from the component datasheets or created from the schematic design tools.
